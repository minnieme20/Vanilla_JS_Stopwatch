## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a modern web browser and a code editor installed on your computer.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/minnieme20/Vanilla_JS_Stopwatch.git

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser or edit the code using your favorite code editor.

## How It Works

The stopwatch is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how it functions:

- **HTML:** Provides the structure of the stopwatch, including elements to display hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. It also includes buttons for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch.

- **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements to create an attractive and user-friendly interface. It defines the appearance of the stopwatch and buttons.

- **JavaScript:** Implements the logic behind the stopwatch. It uses `setInterval` function to update the time values every 10 milliseconds, creating the illusion of real-time tracking. The JavaScript code handles the start, pause, and reset functionalities.

## Usage

1. **Start:** Click the "Start" button to begin the stopwatch. The timer will start counting up from zero.

2. **Stop:** Click the "Stop" button to temporarily stop the stopwatch. The timer will pause until you click "Start" again.

3. **Reset:** Click the "Reset" button to reset the stopwatch to zero. It will clear all the displayed time values.
